Kingdom allows you to dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements using a virtual DOM. 
This is particularly handy when you have massive changes to apply to the DOM. This framework is simple, but admittedly
 it is kinda kitchy and may weird to remember methods, but there was a method to the madness! Once you understand the
  concept everything will make perfect sense. If you don't care, I've documented all the methods so you can spare 
  your eyes of all the kitchiness. [To see the docs check out the documentation folder.](./documentation/index.html)
